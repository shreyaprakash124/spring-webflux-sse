## General info
Server-Sent-Events, or SSE for short, is an HTTP standard that allows a web application to handle a unidirectional event stream and receive updates whenever the server emits data.
In this project, we make use of implementations such as the Flux class provided by the Reactor library, or potentially the ServerSentEvent entity, which gives us control over the events metadata.

Flux is a reactive representation of a stream of events â€“ it's handled differently based on the specified request or response media type. An SSE is a specification adopted by most browsers to allow streaming events unidirectionally at any time.
The **events** are just a stream of UTF-8 encoded text data that follow the format defined by the specification.
